# Scanning-Tool
Item scanning tool

- C# based application for the shop floor that captures information with a Cognex scanner, puts it into a textbox, makes a SQL call to verify if that serial number has ever been scanned, if not you can continue, and if it has it would show an error that tells you when the item was scanned, it shows a timer and a counter of the number of pieces scanned in the actual and past hour.
- It verifies that the piece that you scan it the good one because it finds an specified index in the serial number to check it
- Verifies internet connection status
